## Introduction
The Pose Estimation with OpenCV project demonstrates the principles of human pose estimation using computer vision techniques. The project uses OpenCV to detect key points on the human body and estimate the poses.

## Features
- Real-time pose estimation from video streams
- Detection of key points on the human body
- Visualization of detected poses
- Support for multiple video formats

## Software Requirements
- Python (3.6 or later)
- OpenCV (4.0 or later)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- Optional: Matplotlib (for plotting and visualization)

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sployal/pose_estimator
